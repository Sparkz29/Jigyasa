2. Eukaryotic cells - have a nucleus

### Plant vs Animal Cells
Plant cells have:

- Centrosomes

## Chapter 2: Photosynthesis

Photosynthesis is the process by which plants make their own food using sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water.

The equation for photosynthesis is:
6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy â†’ C6H12O6 + 6O2

This process happens in the chloroplasts of plant cells.
